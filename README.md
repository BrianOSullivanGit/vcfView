# vcfView
An interactive Rshiny tool designed to support the evaluation of somatic mutation calls from cancer sequencing data. The tool takes as input a single variant call format (VCF) file and enables  researchers to explore the impacts of analytical choices on the mutant allele frequency spectrum, on mutational signatures and on annotated somatic variants in genes of interest. It allows variants that have failed caller filters to be re-examined in order to improve sensitivity or guide strategies for optimal sample / sequencing preparation. It is extensible allowing other algorithms to take advantage of its VCF preprocessing capabilities.

vcfView is still under development. We welcome and encourage your feedback to BrianOSullivan@yahoo.com. If you encounter a problem or have a feature or enhancement requests please raise an issue (https://github.com/BrianOSullivanGit/vcfView/issues). We are particularly interested in making vcfView more relevant for use in a clinical setting. If you have any suggestions on what we should do to achieve that please let us know.

Finally, vcfView takes VCF files as its input. These files can contain sensitive, patient specific data. For this reason we do not recommend you host vcfView on a server. Please run it on your local machine only. Also, please be aware of and fulfill your responsibilities to protect the privacy of individuals' genomic information.
